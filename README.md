 In this project, we developed a framework for lung disease
identification, i.e. Covid, Lung opacity and Normal using
chest X-rays. We performed image processing tasks, segmentation
and used a deep convolutional neural network
to train the data. To combat the black-box nature of this
complex classification model and increase the transparency,
we explain the prediction by different methods, i.e. Layerwise
relevance propagation(LRP), Local Interpretable Model
Agnostic Explanation(LIME), Guided back-propagation (GB)
and Deep Taylor decomposition (DTD).We further evaluate the
explanations generated by these methods using image entropy
and evaluate heat maps generated by LRP, Guided backpropagation
and Deep taylor decomposition using the pixel
flipping algorithm.
