# Explainable-Deep-Learning-for-Lung-Disease-detection-from-X-rays
The coronavirus has created an enormous health crisis in 2020 globally. An efficient approach to detect the virus can help to start treatment fast. In medical diagnosis deep learning techniques have been efficacious and fast. But the black box nature of these deep learning models has become a hurdle for them to adapt to industries, especially in health care. In this project chest X-rays will be used to detect if a person has Corona virus, Pneumonia or is healthy. To classify we will be using feature combination approach. To combat the black box nature and increase the transparency of these models we will use 2 explainable AI methods; Layer wise back propagation, Deep Taylor Decomposition and LIME.
